# Assigning Permissions to your Advisors

## What are permissions?

Assigning permissions to your WhatsApp Connect advisors enables them to perform specific tasks, for example to create a chat room. Once a permission has been assigned to an advisor, that advisor will have access to the permissionâ€™s functionality in the WhatsApp Connect application.

## How are permissions assigned?

Most WhatsApp Connect permissions need to be assigned by an Administrator in your company using the Connect API. \(Permission to onboard clients can be assigned using either the Connect API or the Admin Portal.\) Permissions are available to assign to your advisors depending on the role they have within your company. For more information and a complete list of permissions available, please refer to the [Symphony Federation API Reference Guide](https://federation.readme.io/reference). 

## Permissions versus entitlements

Permissions are more specific than entitlements. Entitling an advisor to the WhatsApp Connect extension app gives that advisor the right to use WhatsApp Connect. Assigning that advisor a permission gives the advisor access to functionalities within WhatsApp Connect. An entitlement is a precondition for a permission. If you want to give the permission "create:room" to an advisor, that advisor must already have the WhatsApp entitlement. See [Provisioning Your Users for WhatsApp Connect](untitled-1.md) above for more information.
