# About Messaging in WhatsApp Connect

## **Sending attachments**  

Your company can choose whether to permit sending attachments via WhatsApp Connect \(for example, images and file attachments\). See [Appendix: Supported File Attachments](appendix-supported-file-attachments.md) for more information.  


## **Unsupported Content notifications**

Error messages will notify your users if they try to send unsupported content. 

Similarly, for features like inline replies or table insertion, not yet supported by WhatsApp Connect, you will be notified that these features are not supported and that you’ll need to convert this content to standard text prior to transmitting.

If your WhatsApp client attempts to send unsupported content, they’ll receive an explanatory error message you’ll receive a message explaining that the WhatsApp client attempted to send you some unsupported content.  


## **Messaging limitations**

Messages are limited to ****30,000 characters. A notification that the message has been truncated is sent to the WhatsApp client when sending more than 30,000 characters
