# Manage Client Connections

### \*\*\*\*

## **Removing Clients**

## **Automatically Offboard Clients Who Don't Respond** 

The system now automatically offboards a client invited to WhatsApp Connect, if the client does not accept the invitation via WhatsApp within a fixed period of time. The default time period is 7 days elapsed, including weekends. The client being offboarded receives a customised template message: You have been removed from this conversation due to not accepting the Terms of Use. Messages will no longer be sent to \[clientâ€™s contact information\].

### Configure the Response Time after which a non-responding client is offboarded

Your firm can set the number of days that should elapse before the client is auto-offboarded, after the invitation is sent. If you set this number to zero, client invitations will not expire and clients will not be auto-offboarded. Please contact Symphony Support if you wish to implement this setting or for more information.

### Configure the execution of auto-offboarding checks

As an Admin, you can now configure the execution of ****the auto-offboarding checks   using10-minutes slots instead of hourly slots  


## **Contact Status**

Symphony users can view the status of their WhatsApp Connect contacts:

**Active**   
the WhatsApp user is within the 24-hour window or a conversation is in progress. 

**Inactive**  
the WhatsApp user has not responded to the last message within 24 hours. 

**Pending**   
the WhatsApp user has not yet accepted the first invitation to communicate via WhatsApp Connect.

**Unknown**  
 in some rare cases the status is Unknown.
