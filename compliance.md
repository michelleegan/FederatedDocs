## **Audit Trail**

You can display a Symphony user’s connection request data from the Symphony Admin Portal.

1. Locate the user’s details from BROWSE ACCOUNTS in the navigation bar.
2. Click on the AUDIT TRAIL tab.
3. Use filtering to find the specific information your need: connection requests and/or a date range

Connection requests are displayed as follows:

Note: The request appears to be coming from the WhatsApp user \(although it is your employee who initiated the request\). This is because the connection is generated by the WhatsApp Connect app.  
  


## **Content Export**

All messages sent and received between a Symphony advisor and a WhatsApp client are included and tagged in the content delivered to the retention archive via Symphony Content Export. Specific tags identify WhatsApp Connect messages. Symphony XML, EML and Actiance formats are supported. Refer to Appendix: Content Export Format for more information.   


Your company may need to implement additional features in its surveillance and archiving systems to accommodate these format changes. Full documentation is available from your Symphony account team.
